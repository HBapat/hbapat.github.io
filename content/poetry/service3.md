And there in a circumstance somewhat cliché,  
listening to what the waves had to say,  
staring at the skyline silhouette,  
discovered something most intriguing yet.  

And sitting there amidst the quiet  
of strangers’ voices and broken thought,  
As those harbour lights dance  
to songs the sea sang  
I finally began  
to enjoy my own company
