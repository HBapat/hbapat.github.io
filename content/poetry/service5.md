On a cold winter’s night, through the billowing wind,  
walked a hooded figure across the land.  
With a scythe slung across his back,   
Eyes fixed upon the task at hand.  

Few could see him, those who could,   
shrunk back in disbelief and fear.  
And he looked back at them in pity,   
for they were in for days of tear

He first stopped to visit a person  
very new to the middle earth  
to admit her into the world  
 and soon to vacate her berth.  

His job was cruel, but just as necessary,   
and nevertheless was without choice.  
So without another thought commenced,   
to interrupt much joy and rejoice.  

Next he stopped at a soldier’s,   
a mighty warrior struck in fight.  
Masking his fear of reality behind   
walls of courage and might.  

As the reaper appeared in front of him,  
he realized, his time was over  
and out fell tears of sorrow and sadness  
as his barrel chest heaved slower and slower.  

Last for that day the reaper stopped  
to meet a man not known by many.  
For despite being aged in many ways,  
was avoided by most, and branded uncanny.  

But as the reaper approached the old man  
on his deathbed, accompanied only by his wife.  
Smiled serenely and warmly,   
and greeted Death like a friend for life.
