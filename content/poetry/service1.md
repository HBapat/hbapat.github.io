Sailor on the sprawling sea  
Lost you seem, lost within  
Drawn out by its beauty  
The tide in the cold betrays  
Where is your family? Where is your kin?  

Look up, look past the clouds  
And guide your ship beyond the rocks,  
against the tide, through the froth and foam.  
And I will be your north star shining  
And I will guide you home.  


And when the sun has set,  
and the stars refuse to shine,  
Know,  
that I will be right beside you,  
with your hand in mine.
