A little red thread  
From a snug red scarf  
One I held close, or did it, me?

A little red thread  
Stuck out pretty sore  
Peering and pricking and nagging  
Like a thorn from a rose

I tugged a bit  
For how bad could it be  
I would still have the scarf  
And warm it would keep me  

But once I started pulling,  
I would not stop, and stop I could not,  
Soon I had eaten through half,   
And it ate my heart out

Cross-legged, hanging in shame  
I sat as the tears rolled.  
Left with a bundle of yarn  
Shivering out in the cold.
