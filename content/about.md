### Hi, I'm Harsha, nice to meet you. 

I am a financial engineering graduate student at Cornell University. I am from Pune, India, and currently reside in New York City. 

Professionally, I am interested in all things finance, from traditional industry analysis and company valuation to crypto and DeFi. I am curious about developments in tech and their implications to the financial markets, and am fascinated by astronomy and space travel. 

On a personal note, I am passionate about football (soccer), I enjoy playing in my free time and support the club Manchester United. I also follow Formula 1, and most other sports to some extent. I am an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction, I thoroughly enjoy learning about history, and I write poems when the inspiration strikes. I enjoy traveling and hiking, and hope to see as much as I can of this beautiful world!
