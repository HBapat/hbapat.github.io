      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Harsha, nice to meet you. I am a financial engineering graduate student at Cornell University. I am from Pune, India, and currently reside in New York City.
Professionally, I am interested in all things finance, from traditional industry analysis and company valuation to crypto and DeFi. I am curious about developments in tech and their implications to the financial markets, and am fascinated by astronomy and space travel.</description>

      <description>Sailor on the sprawling sea
Lost you seem, lost within
Drawn out by its beauty
The tide in the cold betrays
Where is your family? Where is your kin?
Look up, look past the clouds
And guide your ship beyond the rocks,
against the tide, through the froth and foam.
And I will be your north star shining
And I will guide you home.
And when the sun has set,</description>

      <description>Does the sea speak to you?
Can you hear it, what does it say?
Do the waves, iridescent blue,
Do they make your heart sway?
With the golden horizon so near,
Nearly within arm’s length
I hear Poseidon call me home
I ask myself, if not now, then when?
Behind me, the moon appears
Making the waves dance and shimmer
A silent reminder of my dreams and ambition
Controlling those waves I hold so dear</description>

      <description>And there in a circumstance somewhat cliché,
listening to what the waves had to say,
staring at the skyline silhouette,
discovered something most intriguing yet.
And sitting there amidst the quiet
of strangers’ voices and broken thought,
As those harbour lights dance
to songs the sea sang
I finally began
to enjoy my own company</description>

      <description>A little red thread
From a snug red scarf
One I held close, or did it, me?
A little red thread
Stuck out pretty sore
Peering and pricking and nagging
Like a thorn from a rose
I tugged a bit
For how bad could it be
I would still have the scarf
And warm it would keep me
But once I started pulling,
I would not stop, and stop I could not,</description>

      <description>On a cold winter’s night, through the billowing wind,
walked a hooded figure across the land.
With a scythe slung across his back,
Eyes fixed upon the task at hand.
Few could see him, those who could,
shrunk back in disbelief and fear.
And he looked back at them in pity,
for they were in for days of tear
He first stopped to visit a person
very new to the middle earth</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn&amp;rsquo;t eat for three weeks. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men.
